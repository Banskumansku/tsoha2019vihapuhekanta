 # What??
 User has their own profile and can add tweets using their id to db, with a radio button to classify them to categories
 
 Admin can make combined searches eg offensive/nothate, nothate, hate/offensive, notoffensive/hate and import them as jsons
 
 # Why??
 As of now hatespeech analysis is in its infancy and to help it progress a way to add offensive and or hateful material to a central place will be helpful with the automation of hate speech detection
